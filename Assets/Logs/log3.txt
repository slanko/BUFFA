SPECIAL CANCELLING:

OKAY. so we're gonna need a FUNKY VALUE.

FLOAT?? INT. NO, YOU DINGUS. FLOAT. YOU NEED FLOAT.

YEAH OKAY. SO WHEN YOU START A MOVE SET IT TO UHHH WHATEVER IT NEEDS TO BE

LIKE, IF IT'S 0 THEN IT ISN'T CANCELABLE

BUT IF IT'S SAY 50 IT'S CANCELLABLE ON THE 50TH FRAME

NEARLY A SECOND ????? YEAH FUCK YOU


AAAAANYWAY. WAIT. YOU'RE A FUCKING DUMB.... JUST HAVE A MOVE CALLED CURRENTMOVE AND YOU CAN GET ALL YOUR INFO FROM THAT

WHEN YOU DO ANY MOVE SET CURRENTMOVE TO THAT

THEN WHEN THE ANIM FINISHES OR YOU GET INTERRUPTED SWAP IT OUT FOR A NULL
