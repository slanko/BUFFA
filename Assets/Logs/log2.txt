IT:OKAY: SO.

how do we do side switching?? 
IF TRANSFORM.POS X > TARGET.POS.X LOOK LEFT
IF TRANSFORM.POS.X < TARGET.POS.X LOOK RIGHT

FACING ENUM?? BOOL?? 

I FWEAKING WOVE WADIOHEAD

YEAH FUCK IT BOOL FACINGLEFT
IT'S LESS MESSY THAN AN ENUM
OR MAYBE LEFTOFOPPONENT

THAT READS WELL

IF FALSE THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY RIGHT OF THE OPPONENT OR DIRECTLY ABOVE THEM IN WHICH CASE GET FUCKED

ALRIGHT. THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH INPUTS???? FLIP 'EM, BUT ONLY FOR MOVE INPUTS. KEEP MOVEMENT THE SAME
IF NOT THAT'D BE FUCKED UP

(CHARACTER THAT HAS TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF SPECIAL MOVES DEPENDING ON THE SIDE HE'S ON??)

WRITE AN INPUT BUFFER DEAL THAT SPITS OUT FLIPPED INPUTS

THEN ON SPECIAL CHECKING CHECK FLIPPED INPUTS INSTEAD IF ON THE FLIPSIDE

IT"S NOT IN THE FREAKING INPUT BUFFER SCRIPT IT'S IN THE READ INPUT SECTION DO IT THERE

okay alright level headed zen mode

um so i'd like to not have to do another foreach and instead be able to send the inputs flipped but that is not going to happen

but: there's only two homies on screen. they can have a few for loops. as a treat

LOL SWITCH STATEMENT GET FUCKED STUPID

alright. \


THAT WAS FUN!!! (it was not)

what next>???


so we need: movement values for specific moves

hitboxes (oh GOD)

HOW R WE GONNA HANDLE X/Y MOTION 4 MOVES

well. we're gonna have a value, right. and we animate that value. and we add it to the movement transform?? OR. if DOINGMOVE is active we transform.translate that value. that's better.

HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT DOINGMOVE


WELL FIRST we need to sort out the last of the scriptableobject system, which is the animation triggers. instead of triggering triggers we need to instead anim.play animations from the scriptableobject and then find when they are done to transition back into lovely idle state
